# To do list
![ToDoList](https://github.com/ArthurSantDev/ToDoList/assets/159972613/19950f4d-d547-4118-86e4-2f27bc0a0486)

This project is a To-Do List, with features to add and delete tasks, search options, and categories to further distinguish and customize your tasks. Initially the project was just for studying JavaScript and React, but I ended up dedicating myself a little more to make it a little more complete so I could have the freedom to put it as an example in my portfolio.

## Learnings
![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-%23323330.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=%23F7DF1E) My biggest challenge in this project was for the first time structuring an application with events that changed the state of other things, with this being my first project entirely based on Javascript, it was important to maintain coherence in the code so as not to get confused and difficult to maintain. I learned how to create additions and subtractions of items, filter and what was a difference for me, research tasks. I thought this activity would be difficult but I was surprised by its simplicity.

![Vite](https://img.shields.io/badge/vite-%23646CFF.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=vite&logoColor=white) During this project, my biggest challenge was structuring an application with events that change the state of other parts of the application. As this is my first project entirely based on JavaScript, it was essential to maintain code coherence to avoid confusion and maintenance difficulties. When working with Vite.js, I learned how to structure an application using this Framework, that using a css image requires a specific way of requesting folders, I learned how to create useful and reusable components, and the main thing was the fundamentals that made Vite.Js more agile than just using React to create the application.
